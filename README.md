## Usage

First you will have to clone down the repository. Once you have completed that, enter the cloned down project directory and run it in your browser.

You can run the app using [serve](https://github.com/vercel/serve) from Vercel.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/waylonturbes/sparkle-up.git
cd sparkle-up
npx serve
```

If you are using VSCode, you can use the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension by Ritwick Dey to run this.

Now that the app is running, you can use the _Add a sparkling water_ form to add new sparkling waters.

If you wish to edit sparkling waters that have already been made, you can do so by clicking on the pencil icon on the right hand side of a sparkling water list item, and the _Add a sparkling water_ form will fill with all the sparkling water values.
