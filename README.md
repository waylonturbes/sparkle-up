## Usage

This project is a work in progress. If you go to the `/sparkle-up` route, you can use the _Add a sparkling water_ form to add new sparkling waters.

```json
{
  "flavor": "Lemon",
  "brand": "La Croix",
  "rating": 10,
  "review": "The best sparkling water."
}
```

If you wish to edit sparkling waters that have already been made, you can do so by clicking on the pencil icon on the right hand side of a sparkling water list item, and the _Add a sparkling water_ form will fill with all the sparkling water values.
