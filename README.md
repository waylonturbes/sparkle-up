# Sparkle Up

Sparkle Up is a small app built with Vue and Vuetify.

## Usage

First you will have to clone down the repository. Once you have completed that, enter the cloned down project directory and run it in your browser.

I like to run the app using [serve](https://github.com/vercel/serve) from Vercel.
Here is an example using the HTTPS clone method:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/waylonturbes/sparkle-up.git
cd sparkle-up
npx serve
```

Now that the app is running, you can use the _Add a sparkling water_ form to add new sparkling waters. &#10024; Sparkle Up &#10024;

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. This app is a work in progress, so many features and fixes can/will be made.

If you wish to edit sparkling waters that have already been made, you can do so by clicking on the pencil icon on the right hand side of a sparkling water list item, and the _Add a sparkling water_ form will fill with all the sparkling water values.
